Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
-- Steve Jobs

2. (1 point)
Note: For questions 2 and 3, place each answer inside a <p> tag. Also use character entities so the actual tags are visible on the web page.
Ex: &lt;img src="test.png"&gt; renders as <img src="test.png">

Question 2: Print an ampersand in an HTML comment.

<!-- & -->
